This is just the readme doc.

If you make any new changes to the project that you think need to be
posted to the group, you can post them here.

Also we can put what we're each working on or what we plan to work on in
here as well. 

Alex: Getting this repository up and running for Thursday's group is my primary goal.
After this I'll probably get started on my mid-term.
