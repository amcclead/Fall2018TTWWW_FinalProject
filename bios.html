  Megan Hughes comes from the barren land of Lancaster, Ohio. She spends her free time channeling the inner powers of Tina Fey and Chris Farley to create comedy that makes life worth living. She received her Bachelor of Arts in Anthropology from Ohio University and somehow ended up in Chicago, IL where she frequents the Second City Training Center. She is an advocate for Human Rights and loves going to the movies.

  <p>
  Alice Jasmine Crippa comes from the unfashionable ghetto suburbs of Milan. When it’s warm, you can find her outside doing yoga or hiking. When it’s cold she is inside, still doing yoga and hosting Italian dinners. She obtained her Master of Science in Communication Design from the Polytechnic University of Milan, where she teaches a workshop in collaborative practices for creative thinking. She came to Chicago by saying “YES” to a Creative Director position in the advertising industry, and then fell in love with all the yeses she can say as an improv student of the Second City Training Center. Baci e ciao belli.

    Apratim
  </h3>

  <p>
    Apratim Vidyarthi and his unpronounceable name come from Delhi, though he considers his collection of hometowns to include the Bay Area and Chicago. His name means unique student, which is fitting because he's spent four years in college, one in grad school, and is aiming to go to law school. He currently works in consulting, which is glorified googling and requires humor for survival. Apratim began stand-up at Second City, inspired by his idol, Jon Stewart. He yes and-ed his way into improv, and enjoys making jokes about his name, his Indian-ness, and his immigrant experience. In his free time, you can find him playing tennis, eating steak, and getting into arguments.
