  	<p>We HEART Chicago!!!
The Windy City blew all of us recent and not-so-recent
immigrants together in 2018 and we sure are glad she
did. Of course, we also heart Cloud Gate—did you
know that’s the real name for the Bean?—but we would
have never met without the genius and support of all
the faculty at The Second City Training Center. We pay
particular homage to Mark Czoske, our former faculty
and current Director. I’m serious: we actually pay him in
real dollars—so come see our shows and help us to
keep paying him! In addition, we have also trained at
the equally-wonderful iO Theater! It is there that we
finetune our ensemble and music improv skills to the
best of our abilities. Or maybe just to our average
abilities? We’re hoping the former. You decide!
